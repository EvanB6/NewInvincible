            PANIC. THE THREE MISSING STUDENTS, THOUGH REPORTED MISSING ON DIFFERENT DAYS,
            DID KNOW EACH OTHER. IT'S POSSIBLE THIS WAS PLANNED BY THEM AND NO FOUL PLAY HAS
            TAKEN PLACE. STILL, WE CALLED THIS SCHOOL MEETING SO THAT THE RUMORS WOULDN'T
            OVERWHELM THE TRUTH. YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW. JUST TO BE SAFE TRY NOT TO GO
            ANYWHERE ALONE, AND PLEASE REPORT ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS TO EITHER ME OR ANY OF THE
            OTHER PEOPLE YOU SEE HERE BESIDES ME.

            <span class="speaker">Mayor: </span>IF WE'RE LUCKY, THE MISSING STUDENTS WILL SHOW UP AND
            EVERYTHING WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL, BUT UNTIL THEN KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN. IF ANY OF
            YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND MORE
            THAN LIKELY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. YOU CAN ALL GO BACK TO CLASS NOW. JUST GO
            ON TO FOURTH PERIOD FROM HERE. PEOPLE WHO ARE ON FIRST LUNCH PERIOD CAN GO ON TO
            THE CAFETERIA. THE BELL WILL RING IN SEVEN MINUTES, PLEASE BE WHERE YOU'RE
            SUPPOSED TO BE BY THEN.
