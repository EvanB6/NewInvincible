<span class="speaker">Mayor?: </span>WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE AUTHORITIES TO GlVE THEM
                    ALL THE INFORMATION WE CAN IN ORDER TO HELP THEM LOCATE THE MISSING STUDENTS.
                    .<br/>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<span class="speaker">Mayor: </span>I MUST STRESS TO YOU ALL THAT THIS IS NOT A REASON TO
                    PANIC. THE THREE MISSING STUDENTS, THOUGH REPORTED MISSING ON DIFFERENT DAYS,
                    DID KNOW EACH OTHER. IT&#x27;S POSSIBLE THIS WAS PLANNED BY THEM AND NO FOUL PLAY HAS
                    TAKEN PLACE. STILL, WE CALLED THIS SCHOOL MEETING SO THAT THE RUMORS WOULDN&#x27;T
                    OVERWHELM THE TRUTH. YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW. JUST TO BE SAFE TRY NOT TO GO
                    ANYWHERE ALONE, AND PLEASE REPORT ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS TO EITHER ME OR ANY OF THE
                    OTHER PEOPLE YOU SEE HERE BESIDES ME.<br/>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<span class="speaker">Mayor: </span>IF WE&#x27;RE LUCKY, THE MISSING STUDENTS WILL SHOW UP AND
                    EVERYTHING WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL, BUT UNTIL THEN KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN. IF ANY OF
                    YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, I&#x27;LL BE IN MY OFFICE IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND MORE
                    THAN LIKELY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. YOU CAN ALL GO BACK TO CLASS NOW. JUST GO
                    ON TO FOURTH PERIOD FROM HERE. PEOPLE WHO ARE ON FIRST LUNCH PERIOD CAN GO ON TO
                    THE CAFETERIA. THE BELL WILL RING IN SEVEN MINUTES, PLEASE BE WHERE YOU&#x27;RE
                    SUPPOSED TO BE BY THEN.<br/>
