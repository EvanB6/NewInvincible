            <p> This is the Project Team for the Invincible Comics Project, where we'll be looking
                into comic book markup and going through a couple issues of the first compendium.
                This project is being worked on by Connor Carpenter, Kendall Rodriguez, Rachel
                Retterath, and Evan Bartley.<a class = "linkcolor"

                    <p>Mark Grayson is a normal high school student—except his dad is Omni-Man, the
                        most powerful superhero on Earth. When Mark finally develops his own powers
                        as a teenager, he adopts the hero name Invincible and begins learning what
                        it means to save the world while still managing everyday life. He joins a
                        new generation of young heroes, fights his first villains, and embraces his
                        new role—believing he’s following in his father’s noble footsteps. But
                        things take a dark turn when a shocking revelation hints that Omni-Man’s
                        mission on Earth may not be heroic at all, setting up a dangerous future for
                        Mark and the entire planet.</p>

                <p>The schema we used for our xml markup of the comic issues 1-4 is provided in the
                    iamge to the right. The schema follows a simple rule set of a main ontainer of
                    comic that holds the pages of each issue followed by each panel on the page and
                    who each speaker is.</p>
