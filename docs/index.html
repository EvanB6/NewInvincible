            <p> This is the Project Team for the Invincible Comics Project, where we'll be looking
                into comic book markup and going through a couple issues of the first compendium.
                This project is being worked on by Connor Carpenter, Kendall Rodriguez, Rachel
                Retterath, and Evan Bartley.<a class = "linkcolor"

                    <p>Mark Grayson is a normal high school student—except his dad is Omni-Man, the
                        most powerful superhero on Earth. When Mark finally develops his own powers
                        as a teenager, he adopts the hero name Invincible and begins learning what
                        it means to save the world while still managing everyday life. He joins a
                        new generation of young heroes, fights his first villains, and embraces his
                        new role—believing he’s following in his father’s noble footsteps. But
                        things take a dark turn when a shocking revelation hints that Omni-Man’s
                        mission on Earth may not be heroic at all, setting up a dangerous future for
                        Mark and the entire planet.</p>

                <h2>Schema</h2>
                
                <p>
                    The schema we used for our XML markup of the comic issues 1–4 is provided
                    in the image to the right.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This schema follows a simple and organized rule set that defines the overall
                    structure of the comic.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    At the highest level, a main comic container holds each
                    issue, which is then broken down into individual pages.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Each page is further divided into panels, allowing us to represent the layout
                    of the comic in a logical and readable way.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Within each panel, the schema identifies dialogue, captions, and actions,
                    as well as who each speaker is.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This structure helped keep our markup consistent across all issues and made
                    it easier to track characters and dialogue throughout the project.
