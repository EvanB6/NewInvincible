        <p> This is the Project Team for the Invincible Comics Project, where we'll be looking into
            comic book markup and going through a couple issues of the first compendium. This
            project is being worked on by Connor Carpenter, Kendall Rodriguez, Rachel Retterath, and
            Evan Bartley. </p>

            <p>Mark Grayson is a normal high school student—except his dad is Omni-Man, the most
                powerful superhero on Earth. When Mark finally develops his own powers as a
                teenager, he adopts the hero name Invincible and begins learning what it means to
                save the world while still managing everyday life. He joins a new generation of
                young heroes, fights his first villains, and embraces his new role—believing he’s
                following in his father’s noble footsteps. But things take a dark turn when a
                shocking revelation hints that Omni-Man’s mission on Earth may not be heroic at all,
                setting up a dangerous future for Mark and the entire planet.</p>
