            Okay son, you may have noticed by now that I'm not like normal dads. I've... 
            avoided the subject for far too many years, and your mother and I have decided that it's
            time you knew the truth.
            We think you're old enough for me to tell you where I really come from.

            Millions of miles from here, out in deep space, is the planet Viltrum, a cool blue
            oasis alone in a solar system much like our own.
            I was born on this planet

            Its people are not completely unlike humans, although, they and I, have abilities
            in addition to what humans have. We can fly, move at super-speed, and possess great
            strength... by human standards.
            Viltrum was a planet that had achieved a perfect global society. There was no illness,
            no murder, no war, it was a relative utopia.

            With no conflict at hand, our high council refused to let our society become complacent.
            
            </div>
         
         <div class="panel">
            <span class="speaker">Omniman: </span>
            Council memebers argued that rather than revel in our newfound perfection, we should
            take it upon ourselves to ensure that other races, lesser developed than our own,
            should be allowed to develop to our level of advancement.

         <div class="panel">

            It was agreed upon unanimously.
            
            </div>
         </section>

         <div class="panel">
            <span class="speaker">Omniman: </span>
            Shortly after the high council had approved the idea, the world betterment committee
            was formed.
            
            </div>
         
         <div class="panel">
            <span class="speaker">Omniman: </span>
            The first step of the initiative was to locate other plaets that were in a cruical
            stage of development...
            ... Planets that were far enough along that the possibility of greatness was there,
            but were not so far along that their outcome was already decided.
            
            </div>
         
         <div class="panel">
            <span class="speaker">Omniman: </span>
            The second step was to install global defense systems to protect the planet from spaceborne
            menaces, both natural and unnatural, that might prevent the survival of the civilization.
            
            </div>
         
         <div class="panel">
            <span class="speaker">Omniman: </span>
            The final step was to send a team of scientists down to the planet's surface to assist
            in the advancement of the civilization's technologies.
            This team would stay behind on the planet, monitoring its progress.

         <div class="panel">
            <span class="speaker">Omniman: </span>
            Word traveled around our planet about how much food the world betterment committee
            was doing. Soon, it was the most popular profession on Viltrum.
            
            </div>
         
         <div class="panel">
            <span class="speaker">Omniman: </span>
            Of course, when I came of age, I signed up for duty. I was on the search committee;
            my job was to locate and suggest planets that might be eligible for our interference.
            By then, the operation had been expanded and perfected. I was stationed on a mobile
            base that traveled from planet to planet as we discovered them.

         <div class="panel">
            <span class="speaker">Omniman: </span>
            I was in my third year of service when I discovered Earth. I convinced the committee
            to do a physical inspection of the planet.
            During the long journey to Earth, I used our long range sensors to study the planet
            and the civilization that lived there.

         <div class="panel">
            <span class="speaker">Omniman: </span>
            By the time we arrived, I had grown fond of Earth and the people on it. Iwas fascinated
            by the achievements that had accomplished in such a short time.
            I pleaded for authorization to add Earth to our betterment schedule, but it was deemed
            too crude and not developed enough for our interference.
            
            </div>
         
         <div class="panel">
            <span class="speaker">Omniman: </span>
            I refused to give up, and offered an alternative solution. I volunteered to relocate
            to Earth, and be its sole protector, dedicated to the survival of its civilization.
            Due to Earth's location in such a remote area of the universe, I was warned that there
            might not be any chance of returning.

         <div class="panel">
            <span class="speaker">Omniman: </span>
            I went anyway.

            Earth was a vibrant nest of individuality. I marveled at the people I saw as they

            Well, our ride's here, but I can see that a brief introduction is needed before we
            depart.
            We're the teen team. I'm Robot.
            You've met  Atom Eve.
            That's  Rex Splode.
            With Dupli-Kate rounding out the team.
            And you?

            I erased mauler's memories from last night, and left him close to the toy store he
            robbed. He'll be disoriented and will more than likely seek out familiar ground.
            My hypothesis is that he will lead us to his base and we'll be able to figure out
            what his plans for the video game systems were.

            I don't know what happened. All last night is a blur. I remember going out to get
            the new shipment at the Toys B' We... and then... nothing.
            So I came back.

            I don't think you realize how important our work here is. We badly need those extra
            processors. That shipment is already in stock by now, and they wont't be receiving
            another for nearly a month.
